# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview
In this project we were assigned to analyze rideshare data for PyBer, a company that offers vehicles for hire services. The objective of this study is to improve ride sharing services and determine affordability for underserved neighborhoods.

The data ranges from January to early May of 2019 , with this we created a compelling visualization of how the fare changes over the determined period of time and thorugh the different types of cities where the company is present: Urban, Suburban and Rural. 

## Results
### Table: Statistics summary

When we analyze the data from the table we can see that the most profitable drivers are the ones who operate in Rural cities, averaging $34.62 per fare, compared to Suburban and Urban which have an average of $30.97 and $24.53 respectively. We can see there is a negative relationship between the average fare per ride and the total amount of drivers, the more drivers there are in a city type, the cheaper the fares are. The most profitable type of city is Urban, which has a large amount of rides during this period of time - 1625, rides. 

### Line Plot: Total Fare by City Type

In the following line graph we can visualize the Total Fare by City type from January to April. Some main points that we can mention from this analysis is that March is a high demand month for every city type. Urban fares are not stable, they are volatile, going up and down quickly, this might be explained due to weekends, but further analysis is required to determine the reason. Suburban fares are the middle ground with stable fares, having a large demand on March and April. Rural fares are low, due to the type of city.


## Summary
Recomendations for the CEO of PyBer based on the analysis:

1. Consider hiring more drivers for rural cities so that the average fare decreases.

2. Set incentives for drivers from urban and suburban cities to move to rural cities so that the average fare per ride decreases. 

3. A price ceiling according to the level of income in rural cities may be necessary to offer a more affordable service.
