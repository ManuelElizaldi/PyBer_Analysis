# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview
In this project we were assigned to analyze rideshare data for PyBer, a company that offers vehicles for hire services. The objective of this study is to improve ride sharing services and determine affordability for underserved neighborhoods.

The data ranges from January to early May of 2019 , with this we created a compelling visualization of how the fare changes over the determined period of time and thorugh the different types of cities where the company is present: Urban, Suburban and Rural. 

## Results
In the following line graph we can visualize the Total Fare by City type from January to April. Some main points that we can mention from this analysis is that March is a high demand for every city type. Urban fares are not stable, they are volatile, going up and down quickly. Suburban fares are the middle ground with stable fares, haveing a large demand on March and April. Rural fares are low, due to the type of city.
